I am a curious, motivated and active person. I'm always busy building or exploring something new, approaching every project with dedication and a determination to do it the best way I know. I love to delve in and learn about the subjects that spark my attention, such as videogames, science, horror, bodybuilding and, mainly, computer graphics. I am passionate about teaching and sharing back the things I've learned. I aspire to be a person others turn to for expertise. I strive to keep learning and growing through challenging and interesting new projects, while helping those around me do the same.
